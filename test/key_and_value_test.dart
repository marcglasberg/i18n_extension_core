/// That would mean the translatable string is now simply acting as a key,
/// which is not the idea in the first place.
/// But it would work, no problem.
/// Also, i18n_extension can report to the developer
/// that the string in the code and in the translation are out of sync,
/// in case the developer wants to fix it.
/// This problem is also the case with regular keys of old methods:
/// If you update some text and then the key has nothing to do with the text anymore._
